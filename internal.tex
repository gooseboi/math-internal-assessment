\section{Introduction}

My interest in this topic was born when we learned about the notion of second
and higher order derivatives. We learnt that there was a meaning and an
application of taking a derivative multiple times. The notation used to
represent this operation, however, made me relate it to something else.

To represent the second derivative for instance, one writes $\frac{d^2}{dx^2}$,
which encodes the fact that $\frac{d}{dx}$ was written twice by ``multiplying''
them and writing a $2$ in the exponent. This made me think about
exponentiation, which is the process of repeated multiplication, where
similarly $x \cdot x = x^2$. However, for exponentiation, we learn that it is
possible to exponentiate to non-integral, and non-positive powers, such as
$x^{-1}=\frac{1}{x}$ or $x^\frac{1}{2} = \sqrt{x}$, which have meaning and are
useful in solving mathematic problems, and this led me to think about if there
existed a similar notion regarding derivatives.

My focus in this exploration is going to be to find a way to generalise
higher-order derivatives to all $\mathbb{R}$, and not only $\mathbb{Z}^{+}$.
